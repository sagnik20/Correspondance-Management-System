# first-CRUD-app


In this I tried to make a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) app as a part of work for mt Internship at SouthEastern Railway. 
This app keeps a record of all the letters that the department sends and recieves, also all the officials can go through the letters by signing in using their login credentials. Also there is a admin panel where the admin can add and delete employees once a new post gets added or some old post gets dissolved. Officials can add instructions and mark whether they have seen a particular letter or not.
